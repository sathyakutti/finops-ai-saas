### **Solution Validation (8-10 minutes)**

#### **Concept Introduction**
"Based on what you've shared, I'd like to get your thoughts on a concept we're exploring..."

**Present Concept**: 
"Imagine a platform that uses AI to provide real-time cost insights directly in your development workflow - like showing estimated AWS costs right in VS Code as you write infrastructure code, and automatically optimizing resources based on your usage patterns."

#### **Solution Feedback Questions**
8. **"What's your initial reaction to this concept?"**
   - *Listen for*: Excitement level, immediate concerns, clarifying questions

   - *Options*: Real-time cost feedback, AI optimization, developer integration, business context

10. **"What concerns or challenges do you see with this approach?"**
    - *Listen for*: Trust in AI, integration complexity, security concerns

11. **"How would this fit into your current development workflow?"**
    - *Listen for*: Integration points, adoption barriers, workflow changes

12. **"Who on your team would be the primary user of something like this?"**
    - *Listen for*: User personas, decision makers, stakeholders

### **Business Validation (5-7 minutes)**

#### **Current Spend & ROI**
13. **"What do you currently spend on cost management tools annually?"**
    - *Listen for*: Budget range, existing tool costs, decision criteria

14. **"If this platform could save you 20-30% on AWS costs, what would that be worth to your company monthly?"**
    - *Calculate*: Savings potential and willingness to pay

#### **Purchase Intent**
15. **"If we built this platform, how likely would you be to try it on a scale of 1-10?"**
    - *Target*: 7+ indicates strong interest

16. **"What would need to be true for you to become a paying customer?"**
    - *Listen for*: Success criteria, trial requirements, decision process

17. **"Would you be interested in being a design partner to help shape the product?"**
    - *Target*: Identify potential beta customers

### **Closing (2-3 minutes)**

18. **"Is there anything else about AWS cost management that keeps you up at night?"**
    - *Listen for*: Additional problems or use cases

19. **"Do you know other engineering leaders who might face similar challenges?"**
    - *Request*: Referrals for additional interviews

20. **"Would you like to stay updated on our progress?"**
    - *Action*: Add to mailing list for future updates

## Interview Analysis Framework

## Customer Outreach Strategy

### **LinkedIn Outreach Template**
```
Subject: Quick question about AWS cost management (not a sales pitch)

Hi [Name],

I noticed you're leading [engineering/DevOps] at [Company]. I'm researching how teams like yours handle AWS cost optimization challenges.

Would you be open to a brief 20-minute call to share your experiences? I'm not selling anything - just trying to understand the current landscape and pain points.

I can share some interesting insights from other engineering leaders in return.

Best regards,
[Your name]
```

### **Email Follow-up Template**
```
Subject: Thank you + key insights from our conversation

Hi [Name],

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me about AWS cost management at [Company]. Your insights about [specific insight they shared] were particularly valuable.

As promised, here are some key findings from similar conversations:
- 85% of engineering teams say they lack real-time cost visibility
- Average time to detect cost spikes is 3-5 days
- Teams spending 15-20 hours/month on manual cost optimization

I'll keep you updated on our progress. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or additional thoughts.
